- Description
Ada “Coley” Coleman—who preceded legendary bartender Harry Craddock at the Savoy Hotel—had, like any great bartender, a following of devoted regulars. One of them, English stage actor Sir Charles Hawtrey, often came in following a long day requesting “something with a bit of a punch.” On one occasion, Coleman responded with a sweet Martini livened with a splash of Fernet Branca (a bitter Italian amaro), which Hawtrey called, “the real hanky-panky.” To this day, the drink remains Coleman’s most famous invention.
