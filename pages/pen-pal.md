- Description
A play on the Old Pal, a bracing mix of rye whiskey, Campari and dry vermouth, the Pen Pal is the originalâ€™s mellowed-out, but beefed-up cousin. This drink switches out the bitter twang of Campari for the citrus-pop of Aperol, while letting the rye whiskey take the lead with a spicy, whiskey-forward resolve.

* 3/4 ounce Aperol
* Garnish: lemon peel
- Instructions
