- Description
  This combination of fresh apple cider, bourbon and Licor 43 (a citrus and vanilla-tinged Spanish liqueur) is just one pie short of, well, pie. But New York bartender Karin Stanley’s (of Dutch Kills) spicy, creamy ode to apple pie a la mode—represented with lightly whipped brown sugar cream—is almost better than the thing itself. Because, well, bourbon.
- Ingredients
	- 1 ounce [[bourbon]]
	- 1/2 ounce [[Licor 43]]
	- 5 ounces [[apple cider]], fresh
	- 4 ounces [[heavy cream]]
	- 1 cube brown sugar
	- Garnish: freshly grated nutmeg
- Instructions
	- Add heavy cream and brown sugar cube to a cocktail shaker.
	- Add the coil of a hawthorne strainer and dry shake, without ice, for ten seconds or more, to aerate but not whip into stiffness. It must be light but still pourable.
	- In a saucepan, heat bourbon, Licor 43 and cider over low heat until steaming, about 10 minutes.
	- Pour into a tempered mug.
	- Holding a slotted spoon closely over the surface of the drink, float a finger's worth of cream on top of the drink.
	- Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.
