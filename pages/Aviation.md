- Description
  The Aviation can be a tricky cocktail to balance depending on the type of gin, quality of citrus and sweetness of the crème de violette. PUNCH prefers a mild, full-bodied gin like Plymouth. Don't be shy—test the cocktail before straining and serving to ensure a balanced drink. Adjust with a dash of simple syrup or citrus accordingly.
