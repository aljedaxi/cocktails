## Description
Placing second in our recent blind tasting was Death & Co.‘s house recipe for the Corpse Reviver No. 2. This rendition was nearly textbook: equal parts Beefeater Gin, Cointreau, Cocchi Americano and lemon juice, with two dashes of absinthe, mixed with all the ingredients and no garnish. All judges commented on the drink’s fresh, bright quality. “Pretty damn standard,” said Tristan Willey.
