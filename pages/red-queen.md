- Description
Inspired by a number of early twentieth-century recipes for long drinks that rely on a base of red wine, the Red Queen gets extra fortification from the addition of both bourbon and Amaro Braulio, an alpine amaro that adds a cooling, herbal freshness to the drink. As for the name, it’s a reference to a line in the Jefferson Airplane song “White Rabbit.”
