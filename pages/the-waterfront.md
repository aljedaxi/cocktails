- Description
Damon Bolete describes this as a “pretty aggressive highball.” It was on the opening menu of the now-closed Prime Meats in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, where it remained until the end. The drink caught on with industry but as it became more popular he would ask servers to offer a verbal disclaimer to customers just to make sure they knew what they were signing up for. “It’s a medicinal, bitter, and minty Dark ‘n’ Stormy,” says Boelte. “The darkest Dark ‘n’ Stormy.”
