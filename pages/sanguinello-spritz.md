- Description
The spritz is an eternally perfect candidate for riffing and experimentation. This wintry adaptation—itself an adaptation of a cocktail by Nitecap‘s Natasha David—keeps things bitter, bubbly and low-alcohol with fortified wine, homemade vanilla syrup, blood orange juice and, of course, prosecco.
- Ingredients
* 1 ounce blood orange juice
* 1 ounce Cocchi Barolo Chinato
* 1/2 ounce Cappelletti Aperitivo Americano
* 1/2 ounce vanilla syrup (See Editor's Note)
* prosecco, to top
* Garnish: blood orange half-wheel
- Instructions
* Add all ingredients, except prosecco, to a mixing tin.
* Add ice and shake until chilled.
* Strain over ice into a Collins glass and top with prosecco.
* Garnish with a blood orange half-wheel.
* Editor's Note
* Vanilla Simple Syrup:
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup water
* 1 vanilla bean
* Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan. Split open the vanilla bean with a small knife and scrape the contents into the pan; also add the bean pod. Turn the heat on low and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let sit for at least 30 minutes. Strain, bottle and store in the refrigerator for up to one month.
