- Description
  At the Denver’s Cooper Lounge, guests can customize their Vesper selection by choosing between either Smogóry Forest or Lake Bartężek from Belvedere Vodka’s Single Estate Rye series. “People get to compare and contrast,” says Brittany Barbery, Assistant General Manager. The gameplan for the classic drink, inspired by James Bond’s drink order in Casino Royale, is simple: Let the base spirit shine. In this instance, the terroir of either vodka selection becomes the focus, with Smogóry Forest lending savoriness and Lake Bartężek offering a fresher, peppery drink.
