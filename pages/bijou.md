- Description
  This improbable cocktail—a blend of gin, sweet vermouth and Chartreuse—was invented in the United States in the late-19th century. The invention of the drink is commonly attributed to bartender Harry Johnson, who included the recipe in his 1900s tome The Bartender’s Manual, while its name, which means jewel in French, is said to have been inspired by the gem-colored alcohols combined in the recipe. The original formula calls for either a cherry or an olive for a garnish, but history has come down on the correct side of this debate: today’s version uses a cherry.
