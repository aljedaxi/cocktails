## Description
Third place in our recent blind tasting went to James Bolt of The Gin Joint in Charleston, South Carolina. Bolt went for the standard equal parts ratio, choosing Big Gin from Washington State as his spirit, Leopold Bros. as his absinthe, and, in an unusual move, Cointreau Noir, a blend of Cointreau and Cognac, for the liqueur. Like the Death & Co. drink, it was regarded as an upstanding representation of the cocktail.
