For instance, we have a Whiskey Sour on the menu that is made with verjus and preserved nectarines, whose liquid adds an egg white texture without using egg. To bolster the flavor of the nectarines, I add a couple of dashes of sumac tincture that adds some depth and bitterness without the acidic bite ... For example, when making something like a gimlet, use one-quarter ounce of lime juice and make up the rest with verjus or hard cider or something with a funky acidity.
