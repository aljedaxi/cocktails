- [Instead of citrus, we use verjus, hard cider, vinegars and kombucha to brighten up the flavors of cocktails and add acidity ... For instance, we have a Whiskey Sour on the menu that is made with verjus and preserved nectarines, whose liquid adds an egg white texture without using egg. To bolster the flavor of the nectarines, I add a couple of dashes of sumac tincture that adds some depth and bitterness without the acidic bite. It takes some testing, but when creating cocktails, especially recreating classics, we have to think outside of the box. Itâ€™s just a different kind of thought to get your brain accustomed to. Any bar program that wants to lower their lime intake, can begin by just cutting back on proportions. A little goes a long way, and it works well when combined with something that has a soft acidity. For example, when making something like a gimlet, use one-quarter ounce of lime juice and make up the rest with verjus or hard cider or something with a funky acidity. We make a lime tincture using the zest of three or four limes in an over-proof neutral grain spirit, which is another way to add lime flavor without using too much.](https://punchdrink.com/articles/advice-from-americas-bartenders-on-coping-with-the-lime-crisis/)
