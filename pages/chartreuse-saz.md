- Description
  “The first time I made this drink, it was because someone wanted a strong cocktail,” Seth Raymond says of this Sazerac variation. His solution: swap out a half-ounce of simple syrup for yellow Chartreuse. For a less-boozy Sazerac, use a quarter-ounce each of rich simple syrup and yellow Chartreuse; it will still add subtle honey and spice to the drink.
- Ingredients
	- absinthe, to rinse the glass
	- lemon peel
	- 2 ounces Cognac
	- 1/2 ounce yellow Chartreuse
	- 3 dashes Angostura bitters
	- 3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters
- Instructions
	- Pour absinthe into a rocks glass, and rotate the glass to coat the interior. Pour out excess absinthe.
	- Twist lemon peel over glass to express oils, then drop peel into the glass. Set glass aside.
	- Combine remaining ingredients in a mixing glass over ice and stir until chilled.
	- Strain into the prepared rocks glass.
	- Editor's Note
	- Seth Raymond uses an atomizer to coat the interior of the glass with absinthe, but a traditional rinse works well, too.
