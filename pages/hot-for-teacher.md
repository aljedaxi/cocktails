- Description
A tiki-fied version of Hot Buttered Rum, Matthew Belanger and Shannon Tebay’s (of Pouring Ribbons) Hot for Teacher adds banana (Giffard Banane du Brésil), a proprietary “Improved Gardenia Mix”—a blend of honey, butter, cinnamon and Donn’s spices—coconut cream and two types of rum. Served hot, it’s winter’s version of a Caribbean mirage.
