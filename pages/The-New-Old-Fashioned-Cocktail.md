- Description
  This [[Old Fashioned]] cocktail recipe calls for maple syrup instead of plain simple syrup. It's the best Old Fashioned you'll ever have! Recipe yields 1 drink. See note on how to make in bulk.
- Ingredients
	- 2 ounces [[bourbon]] (I like Four Roses)
	- 1/2 to 1 teaspoon [[maple syrup]], to taste
	- 2 dashes [[Angostura [[bitters]]]]
	- Ice, preferably large cubes
	- [[[[orange]] peel]] , for garnish
	- Optional: 1 Luxardo cherry or other [[cocktail cherry]], for garnish
- Steps
	- In a lowball glass, pour in the bourbon, 1/2 teaspoon maple syrup and a couple dashes of bitters. Stir to combine.
	- Add a large ice cube or several small, and gently stir in a circular motion until the drink is very cold, about 20 seconds. Taste, and stir in 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon more maple syrup if you prefer a sweeter drink.
	- Use a vegetable peeler to remove a hefty strip of orange peel. Gently twist it, skin side down, over the drink to release the oils. Then place the orange peel in the glass. Enjoy.
