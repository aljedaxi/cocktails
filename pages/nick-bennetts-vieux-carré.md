- Description
  Taking second place in our blind Vieux Carré tasting was Nick Bennett of New York’s Porchlight, whose recipe called on three-quarters of an ounce of sweet vermouth, albeit a 50/50 blend of Carpano Antica and Cocchi Vermouth di Torino. This was joined by one ounce each of Rittenhouse Rye and Pierre Ferrand 1840 Cognac, a quarter-ounce of Bénédictine, three dashes of Peychaud’s bitters and two dashes of Angostura bitters garnished with a lemon coin. It was considered a more delicate expression of the drink, in which the brandy was not bullied by the rye.
