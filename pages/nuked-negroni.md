- Description
  This is London modernist bartender Ryan Chetiyawardana’s favorite recipe from his first book and, he says, “the one people seem to make and tag me in the most.” This batched version of the classic cocktail takes an unexpected turn by way of a quick infusion in the microwave (yes, the microwave).
