- Description
  
  The winner of our recent Gin and Tonic tasting, Toby Cecchini’s take on the classic is derived from his father’s recipe. The lime skins are julienned into thin strips and then placed in a shaking tin or glass with three ounces of Tanqueray gin, where they are muddled for 20 or 30 seconds, until “the aromatic oil has clearly emerged and the whole has taken on a translucent green from the juice.”
  
  Meanwhile, in a large glass filled with three large, cracked ice cubes, eight ounces of Schweppes tonic is poured. The gin-lime mixture is carefully poured on top of this, so that it appears to float atop the tonic. The lime strips are then pulled from the bottom via tongs to act as a garnish. “Present as such,” writes Cecchini, “making sure to tell the guest to mix the whole together before sipping.”
