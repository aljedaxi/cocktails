- Description
  Inspired by what he calls “the most bitter character in literature,” Toby Maloney’s Eeyore’s Requiem is a “deep dark [[Negroni]], turned on its head.” The drink starts with a base of bitter complexity by stacking three different amari amped up with aromatic French vermouth and juniper-rich gin. “This drink is an excellent foil to the sweet, bumbling, fruity drinks with very little brain,” says Maloney.
