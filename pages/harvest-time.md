- Description
  Peated Scotch in a warm drink? Yes, but here the famous “peat reek” is balanced by plenty of robust (non-alcoholic) apple cider, ginger and citrus. The end result should show the peat as more of a gentle campfire glow than an all-out rager.
  “The cocktail’s flavor profile mimics an apple,” says head bartender and beverage director Shawn Chen, “sweet, tart, crunchy and appetite-inducing, with a hint of smoke.”
- Ingredients
	- 4 ounces [[apple cider]]
	- 3/4 ounce [[peated [[Scotch]]]], preferably BenRiach 10 Year Old Peated Curiositas
	- 1/4 ounce [[Campari]]
	- 1/2 ounce [[ginger syrup]] (2:1, sugar:fresh ginger juice)
	- 1/2 ounce [[[[yuzu]] or [[[[lemon]] juice]]]]
	- Garnish: half [[[[lemon]] wheel]] studded with [[cloves]], [[grated [[cinnamon]]]]
- Instructions
	- Bring apple cider to a simmer in a medium saucepan.
	- Stir in Scotch, Campari, ginger syrup, and yuzu juice.
	- Remove from heat and pour into a heatproof [[mug]] or glass.
	- Garnish with a half lemon wheel studded with cloves and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
