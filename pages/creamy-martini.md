- Description
At the pioneering cocktail bar White Lyan (which closed in April 2017), they used lactic acid—perhaps best known as the agent that gives yogurt or kefir its tang—when looking to enhance savory flavors and round off the edges of a drink; as a milder acid, it actually helps add a fuller, creamy mouthfeel to cocktails, as has a slightly higher pH than citric or malic acid. It’s used in the recipe for the Creamy Martini to, well, give it creaminess.
