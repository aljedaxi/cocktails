- Description
“I really enjoy blanc/bianco vermouth. Mixing it into a cocktail. Drinking it like water in the summer,” says Jane Danger, of Cienfuegos and Mother of Pearl in New York. Here, Danger goes tiki with it, using it in her French Connection, where the vermouth plays nicely with rum to round out an otherwise-bracing combination of bitters, grapes and citrus.
