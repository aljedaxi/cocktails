# El Presidente Recipe
A classic rum cocktail that hasn&#39;t gotten the attention it deserves.
# Ingredients

- 3/4 ounce dry vermouth
- 3/4 ounce orange curacao
- 1 dash grenadine
- Garnish: orange twist
# Steps
- Pour all ingredients into a mixing glass and fill with ice. Stir briskly for 30 seconds, and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Twist a piece of orange peel over the drink and use as garnish.
