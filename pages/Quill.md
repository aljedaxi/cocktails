- Description
This classic is essentially a Negroni with a bit of absinthe added in. But the resulting flavor is far beyond what you might imagine.
- Ingredients
* 1/4 ounce absinthe, to rinse
* 1 ounce London dry gin
* 1 ounce Campari
* 1 ounce sweet vermouth (such as Carpano Antica Formula)
* Garnish: orange twist
- Instructions
* Add the absinthe into a rocks glass and swirl it around to completely coat the inside of the glass.
* Discard the excess and set the glass aside.
* Add the remaining ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.
* Strain into the prepared glass over a large ice cube.
* Express the oils from an orange twist over the drink and garnish with the twist.
