- Description
  A playful nod to the classic midcentury rye cocktail, [[remember the maine]], this drink summons the cherry flavors of sweet vermouth to play against the cocoa hint of the bitters, while Belvedere Vodka’s Smogóry Forest, from the Single Estate Rye series, supplies a velvety texture. The dash of absinthe comes through on the clean, anise-y finish, making for a perfect [[after-dinner]] drink that’s light in texture but [[dessert-like]] in flavor.

- Instructions
