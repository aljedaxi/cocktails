- Description
Mezcal shoots to kill in Steve Schneider&#39;s smoky cocktail that&#39;s bolstered by chile-tinged bitters and a homemade honey-pineapple syrup for sweet balance.
- Ingredients
  - 1 3/4 ounces joven mezcal
  - 3/4 ounce pineapple juice
  - 1/2 ounce lime juice, freshly squeezed
  - 1 ounce honey-pineapple syrup*
  - 3 dashes Bittermens Hellfire habanero shrub
  - Garnish: pink peppercorn, ground
- Steps
  - Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.
  - Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
  - Garnish with a grind of pink peppercorn. *Honey-pineapple syrup: Add two cups honey and one cup hot water into a bottle or jar, stir or shake to combine, and set aside. In a separate container, crush together 50 pink peppercorns and a whole cubed pineapple. Add the peppercorn-pineapple mixture to the honey-hot water mixture and let stand overnight. Strain out and discard solids. Will keep, tightly covered and refrigerated, for up to 1 week.
