- Description 
  Herb sugars can be used in a variety of ways. From sweetening your tea and coffee to sprinkling on top of meringues for a whisper of other-worldly decadence. A light dusting of rose-scented sugar over fresh cream cheese on a morning bagel will transport you to an English cottage garden at high tea time.
- The General Rule of Thumb Proportions: 
  * 1/4 cup leaves, edible flower petals, or herbs 
  * 2 cups sugar 
  * Zest of one citrus fruit of choice (make sure they are organic when using the zest).
- Directions
	- Gently muddle the herbs with a mortar and pestle to bring out their aromatic oils.
	- Mix them into the sugar and zest.
	- Place into airtight containers and shake them every day or so. Ensure there are no clumps.
	- At the two week mark, sift out the herbs and return the sugar to airtight jar. Discard the herbs.
