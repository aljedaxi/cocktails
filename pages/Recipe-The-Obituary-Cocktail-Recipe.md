# The Obituary Cocktail Recipe
The Obituary is an intriguing spin on a gin martini, probably getting its morbid name from the inclusion of absinthe (though a pastis like Pernod can be substituted). The result is a completely new drink; the introduction of an anise-y flavor highlights the aromatics already present in both gin and vermouth.
# Ingredients
- 2 ounces gin
- 1/4 ounce dry vermouth
- 1/4 ounce absinthe or pastis
# Steps
- Combine ingredients with ice and stir until well-chilled. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
