- Description
Considered by some to be the antecedent of the Martini, the Martinez is a sweet spin on the vermouth cocktails popularized in the late 19th century. Traditionally made with Old Tom Gin (a sweetened gin), sweet vermouth and maraschino liqueur, the drink does skew saccharine (we prefer London dry gin), especially in comparison to a dry Martini, but looking at the proportions, it’s easy to see the similarities. There are some squabbles amongst historians as to where the drink came from: some say a bar in the city of Martinez, California; others credit Jerry Thomas making it for a traveler headed to Martinez. The first known published recipe, however, appears in 1884’s The Modern Bartender’s Guide, by O.H. Byron.
