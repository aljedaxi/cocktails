- Description
  Meet the best [[whiskey sour]] recipeâ€”it's full of bourbon and fresh lemon, sweetened with maple syrup and includes a hint of cinnamon (spice is optional). Feel free to multiply the amounts given below by up to four, if you'd like to make a bigger batch in your cocktail shaker all at once.
- Ingredients
	- 1 1/2 ounces (3 tablespoons) Bulleit [[bourbon]] or your bourbon of choice
	- 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) fresh [[[[lemon]] juice]]
	- 2 to 4 teaspoons [[maple syrup]], to taste (I like 3 teaspoons, which is the equivalent of 1/2 ounce or 1 tablespoon)
	- Pinch of ground cinnamon, optional
- Steps
	- Fill a cocktail shaker or mason jar about two-thirds full with ice. Pour in the bourbon, lemon juice, maple syrup and a pinch of ground cinnamon. Securely fasten the lid and shake well.
	- Pour fresh ice into your cocktail glass and strain the cold whiskey sour mixture into the glass. Enjoy!
