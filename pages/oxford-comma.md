- Description
When searching for a gin cocktail to round out Brooklyn cocktail bar Dram’s menu, Jeremy Oertel looked to one of his favorite drinks from the New York tequila bar, Mayahuel. “I wanted to find a way to combine the flavors of a shaken cocktail—called the Loop Tonic—into a stirred cocktail,” says Oertel. “I like the way that celery and green Chartreuse go together, so I maintained those flavors and added maraschino for hint of sweetness.”
He didn’t have a name for it, so he turned it over to Dram’s owner Tom Chadwick who went back to his office to print menus. “My guess is, Tom was probably listing the ingredients and used an oxford comma to separate the final components. He’s a funny guy like that,” he says. “He definitely didn’t name it for the Vampire Weekend song.”
