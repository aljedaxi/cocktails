  > Fat-Washing at Home 
  
  > Heat up any oil or butter of your choice and mix it with a room temperature spirit in a freeze-proof container.
  >  Leave it covered to infuse for few hours; the length of infusion depends on intensity you are after.
  >  Once done, transfer it into a freezer so the fat can turn solid.
  >  Skim the fat from the top and filter the spirit through a coffee filter.
