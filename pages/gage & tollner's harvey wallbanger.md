## Ingredients
-    2 ounces [[gin]], preferably Plymouth
-    3 ounces fresh-squeezed [[orange juice]]
-    1/2 ounce [[lemon juice]] 
-    1/2 ounce [[Galliano]] liqueur
-    1 teaspoon rich [[cane sugar syrup]] (2:1, cane sugar:water)
- Garnish: long curl of [[orange peel]]
## Directions

-    Express orange peel into an empty Collins glass.
-   Arrange orange peel inside the glass, using the back of a bar spoon to place the peel inside the glass. Drop in four or five Kold-Draft ice cubes, one by one, to stabilize the peel. Leave the end of the peel hanging over the glass; it should create a decorative “horse’s neck” curl.
-    Whip-shake all ingredients with ice. (This is a short but vigorous shake designed to create maximum frothiness.)
-    Strain into prepared glass.
