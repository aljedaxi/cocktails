- Description
The improved formula—that is, a traditional recipe gussied up with a splash of this or that—informs many early Martinis poised for a comeback. Take for instance, the Allies Cocktail, a 50/50 Martini dressed up with several dashes of savory-spicy Kümmel (the name refers to the alliance of English gin, French vermouth and Russian Kummel).

  - 1 1/2 ounces dry vermouth
  - 4 dashes Kümmel
