## Description
Inspired by agua fresca, this Campari-based cocktail created by a bartender at The Elysian Bar in New Orleans is shockingly refreshing.
## Ingredients
- 1 sprinkle of salt
- 2 dashes [[cucumber bitters]] (such as The Bitter Truth)
- 1/2 ounce [[[[lime]] juice]] , freshly squeezed
- 2 ounces hibiscus-mint tea*
- 1/2 ounce Campari
- 2 ounces Alessio bianco vermouth
- Garnish: mint sprig
## Steps
- Pour all ingredients into a rocks glass, adding the Campari and vermouth last.
- Add ice and stir.
- Garnish with a mint sprig. *Hibiscus-mint tea: Add 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup dried hibiscus flowers into a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain out flowers, let cool, then add 1/8 cup brewed peppermint tea. Store in a refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
