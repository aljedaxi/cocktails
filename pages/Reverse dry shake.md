  > A reverse [[dry shake]] starts by shaking a cocktail’s ingredients over ice. The drink is then strained and the ice discarded so that the liquid can be re-shaken, without ice (the “dry” step, also called the “mime shake”), after which it’s strained again into a glass. Note the key distinction: The telltale white lather topping sours and fizzes is built up after the “wet” shake (over ice), rather than before.
