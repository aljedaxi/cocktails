- Description
The Mexican Tricycle was born as “a distant cousin to my old coworker Jeff Morgenthaler’s Broken Bike,” a drink that is itself a riff on the classic Bicicletta (Campari, dry white wine, soda water). Smoky mezcal acts as the backbone of the drink, standing up to the sweetness of the cider with an added kick of bitter Cynar—making for a simple, refreshing and low-proof cocktail.
- Ingredients
* 1 ounce mezcal, preferably Del Maguey Vida
* 1 ounce Cynar
* cider, preferably Bantam Wunderkind
* Garnish: lime wheel
- Instructions
* Add mezcal and Cynar to a ten-ounce Collins glass.
* Fill with ice and top with cider.
* Garnish with a lime wheel.
