- Description
This Kalimotxo-inspired riff takes the classic Spanish combination of red wine and Coke in a new direction with the addition of Fernet-Branca and the bitter vermouth Punt e Mes along with a housemade cola syrup. Dow and Marrone tried a number of different amari before realizing that the missing element was Fernet-Branca all along. “Something was missing. That was when the light bulb went off, ‘Lets just try Fernet-Branca,'” says Dow.
