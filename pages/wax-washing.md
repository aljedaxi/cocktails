- Wax-Washing at Home
- Heat up the wax of your choice in a jug immersed in a pot of boiling water (i.e. a makeshift bain-marie).
    While the wax is still hot pour a bit into any glass bottle and then roll the hot wax around to coat the inside of the bottle.
    Pour the spirit of your choice into the bottle and leave to infuse at room temperature for a week (or longer if you fancy). You can reuse the same bottle many times.
