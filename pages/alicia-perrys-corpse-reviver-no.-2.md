- Description
The winning recipe from our blind tasting, Alicia Perry’s Corpse Reviver No. 2 does not strictly adhere to the equal-parts doctrine. It contains one ounce of Plymouth Gin, and three-quarter ounces each of Lillet, Cointreau and lemon juice, while a quarter-ounce of simple syrup lends roundness to the flavor profile. A pastis rinse completes the formula.
