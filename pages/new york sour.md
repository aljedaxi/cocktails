  > He calls for two ounces of bonded Rittenhouse rye, a full ounce of lemon juice and half an ounce of 2:1 syrup made with cane instead of white sugar. That last move is no surprise, as he’s nearly eliminated 1:1 syrups from his recipes altogether, noting that with rich syrups, “there’s less water being integrated into the drink before you’ve shaken it.” For King, the robust measure of lemon, meanwhile, gives his sour recipe the assertive brightness he’s after, while the rich syrup imparts optimal viscosity, “residual sweetness,” and a “golden hue” from the unbleached sugar ... When it comes to the float, King has strong opinions. “This is one of the most important aspects of the New York Sour that I see screwed up all the time–when you see them and it’s half wine, half cocktail, that’s not good.” His recipe calls for what he describes as a “gentle float”—just half an ounce of wine poured atop the rye sour base. “A lot of people will put too much [wine in] because it looks nice to have it be half and half, but you need to be able to get to the Whiskey Sour in the same sip as the red wine.” For King, the interplay between the two elements is at the center of the drink’s allure.
