## [Sugar and water will dissolve easily at room temperature with only some stirring or shaking. Just combine them in equal parts on a scale in a sealable container like a Mason jar and shake until it’s dissolved. If you really need the syrup right now, then toss the sugar and water in a blender.](https://punchdrink.com/articles/how-to-make-your-simple-syrup-off-the-stove)

### For example, it can often be prudent to introduce heat for better flavor extraction when infusing spices, herbs, citrus peels, or any other fruit or vegetable in a syrup. In these cases, I’ll watch the mixture like a hawk, and cut the heat as soon as I see the first sign of a simmer. By doing so, you’ll avoid overextracting the spices, and for added intensity you can always let the mixture sit off the heat, tasting regularly, until it reaches the desired flavor.
