- Description
  Learn how to make a classic Manhattan cocktail with this simple recipe! Quality ingredients and proper technique are all you need to make the best Manhattan you've ever had. Recipe yields 1 cocktail; multiply the ingredients to make more at once (just use a suitably-sized mixing glass).
- Ingredients
	- Ice, for stirring
	- 2 ounces [[rye]] or [[bourbon]] (I like Bulleit Rye)
	- 1 ounce [[sweet [[vermouth]]]] (I like Dolin or Carpano Antica)
	- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
	- 1 Luxardo cherry or other cocktail cherry, for garnish
- Steps
	- Fill a mixing glass a few inches high with ice. Add the whiskey, vermouth and bitters. Stir in a circular motion for about 30 seconds, or until the drink is very cold (if you&#8217;d like a drink with less bite, stir longer).
	- Strain the liquid into a coupe or martini glass. Garnish with a cocktail cherry. Enjoy.
