- Description
  This drink can be done one of two ways, either by aging for one month to two years in glass or, if you’re short on time, for two hours in a 100-degree Fahrenheit water bath. The water bath helps to “soften” the Manhattan and produce an effect similar to the initial marrying you’ll get from aging. If you’re feeling really adventurous you could line the inside of your bottle with beeswax to add another layer of complexity.
- Ingredients
  * Yield: 1 750-milliliter bottle
  * 6 ounces [[bourbon]] 
  * 6 ounces [[rye [[whiskey]]]] 
  * 5 ounces [[sweet [[vermouth]]]] , preferably Cocchi Vermouth di Torino
  * 1 ounce Punt e Mes
  * 1/4 ounce Angostura bitters
  * 1/4 ounce orange bitters, preferably Regans'
  * 7 ounces mineral water
  * 1/4 ounce gomme syrup
- Instructions
  * Combine all ingredients together in a jug.
  * If using the water bath method, seal the liquid into bags and cook in a sous vide machine set at 100 Fahrenheit for 2 hours. Cool, then store the drink in the refrigerator.
  * If aging the cocktail in bottle, add all ingredients to a large glass bottle and leave it to age for at least one month, or up to two years before transferring to the refrigerator. To serve, pour straight into chilled cocktail glasses and garnish with a brandied cherry.
