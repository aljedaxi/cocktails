- Description
  Among the first decisions to make when constructing a Rob Roy is deciding which spirit to use, as the choice between a smoky Islay or a fruitier Highland Scotch can have a drastic effect on the cocktailâ€™s flavor profile. The Bold Rob Roy lives up to its name with two ounces of Laphroaig 10 Years Old Single Islay Malt Scotch Whisky, a full-bodied, peated example, alongside an ounce of Carpano Antica Formula Sweet Vermouth, a rich Italian bottling with strong vanilla and orange peel notes, and two dashes of Angostura bitters.
