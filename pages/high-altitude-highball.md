- Description
In San Francisco, the bartenders at ABV are such big fans of génépy that they like to drink it ice-cold, three dashes of angostura on top. In terms of cocktails, though, Ryan Fitzgerald likes to sneak it into a riff on a Scotch and soda, this one with Japanese whiskey.
“Both Hakushu and génépy come from mountain areas—and both are influenced by the region they come from,” he says. “They work great together in this simple cocktail.”
- Ingredients
* 1 1/2 ounces Japanese whisky, preferably Hakushu
* 1/2 ounce génépy, preferably Dolin Génépy des Alpes
* 6 ounces soda
* Garnish: lemon twist
- Instructions
* Combine whiskey and génépy in Collins glass.
* Top with seltzer and garnish with a lemon twist.
