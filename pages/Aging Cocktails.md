  > We’ve found that you’re better off laying down drinks that lean toward the boozier, sweeter, slightly bitter end of the spectrum (think, Manhattan or Hanky Panky); the depth of flavor holds its own over time, while bitterness adds structure, much like tannins do. But we also like playing with bright drinks that are traditionally made with citrus, like our Milk Punch. We ready them for aging by adding less water (thereby upping the proof), and replacing citrus with powdered acids and distillates. Much like in the darker drinks, a lot of the brighter, more volatile aromas change. We batch these experiments in large volumes, so we can taste the liquid over a period of many years to try and better understand how the liquid transforms.
