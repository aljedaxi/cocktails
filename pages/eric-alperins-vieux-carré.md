- Description
  Eric Alperin, of The Varnish in Los Angeles, took third place in our blind Vieux Carré tasting with his version, which follows a more spirit-forward formula than the original: three-quarters of an ounce of Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, one ounce each of Old Overholt Rye and Pierre Ferrand 1840 Cognac, a quarter-ounce of Bénédictine and two dashes each of Peychaud’s and Angostura bitters. It was deemed “super expressive,” rye-forward and, crucially, “not too thin.” The drink was garnished with a lemon twist and a cherry, the latter the judges’ only minor quibble. It was balanced and robust, and did not shy away from the heavy-hitting nature of the original.
