- Description
  This subtle [[martini]] variation from Phil Ward features a mix of Plymouth gin, Carpano bianco vermouth and Dolin dry vermouth. The ghostly herbal aftertaste comes from letting the liquor sit upon a bed of shiso leaves for a minute before itâ€™s stirred over ice and strained into a shiso-rubbed glass.

- Instructions
