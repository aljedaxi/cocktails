- Description
  Chris Amirault’s homage to the popular [[Cynar [[Julep]]]] is bolstered with a foundation of high-proof rhum and vanilla syrup that results in a less sweet, more refreshing take. The supporting flavors of fresh mint and tart grapefruit juice play off the banana notes of the rhum and complement the herbaceous notes of Cynar. “It’s a high-proof vegetal sipper that goes down quite easy,” he says.
- Ingredients
  * 8 fresh mint leaves
  * 1/2 ounce vanilla syrup (see Editor’s Note)
  * 1 1/2 ounces Cynar
  * 1/2 ounce 100-proof Martinique rhum agricole
  * 1 ounce fresh grapefruit juice
  * Garnish: fresh mint sprig, grapefruit twist
- Instructions
  * Combine the fresh mint and vanilla syrup in the bottom of a julep cup or double Old-Fashioned glass, then muddle lightly to release the fragrant oils in the mint.
  * Fill glass with crushed ice.
  * Pour the Cynar, rhum and grapefruit juice over the ice.
  * Top with more crushed ice, and garnish with fresh mint sprig and a grapefruit twist. Serve with a short straw.
